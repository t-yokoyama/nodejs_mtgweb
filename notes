TODO
 x 1 learn nodejs/express server framework
 x 2 learn socketio for sending events between browsers
 x 3 learn canvas for drawing magic cards
   x figure out how to embed local image into nodejs served file
     (this seems to only work with absolute file paths)
 x 4 learn how to drag an image and persist its location
   - http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
   - http://jsfiddle.net/g6m5t8co/1/
 x find out how to get x/y pos of a card after it's been dragged
   - http://jsfiddle.net/davidThomas/DGbT3/3/
 x use canvas instead of div (what about svg?)
   - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5882716/html5-canvas-vs-svg-vs-div
 x figure out how to set the x/y pos of a card via button/action
   - http://api.jquery.com/offset/ (.offset(x, y);)
 x figure out how to set draggable/offset without manually naming specific id

 - use GIT!!

 - think of data structures/functions necessary for creating/maintaining cards in each zone

   - cards: array with cardId, srcImage, enum state, bool tapped
   - library: ordered array with cardId's
   - hand: is this necessary?
   - graveyard: is this necessary?
   - exile: is this necessary?

   - enum state:
     DECK
     HAND
     BATTLEFIELD
     BATTLEFIELD_FACEDOWN
     BATTLEFIELD_TRANSFORMED
     BATTLEFIELD_FLIPPED
     GRAVEYARD
     EXILE

   - addCard(): adds <img> to DOM, initially draws image face down
   - revealCard(): redraws image face up



 - figure out how to load card data from a database


 - figure out how to change depth ordering of cards
 - implement a status variable? (e.g. boolean tapped)
 - figure out how to do a right-click menu
   - http://www.sitepoint.com/building-custom-right-click-context-menu-javascript/
 - figure out how to spawn a card on the fly (with all features, e.g. draggable)
 - see if jquery can do any of the above


 - ? decide how to animate transitions from opponent
 - ? make an internal database of cards (id, image...)
 - ? learn how to incorporate databases into nodejs server
