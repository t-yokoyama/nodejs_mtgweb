 - write a python script:

      accept command line param for db inserts and/or images
      open json file
      read contents and store each card into a data structure with all fields
        ignore everything except
          set
            name
          card
            layout
            name
            manacost
            cmc
            colors
            types
            subtypes
            rarity
            text
            flavor
            number
            power
            toughness
            multiverseid
      generate a lookup table for set name => 3 digit set id (only the sets we want)
      for each parsed card line
         if set id is in the wanted list
            generate 6 digit uid with set id num + card num
            if db insert option enabled
               write out insert statement to file
            if image extract option enabled  
               go to gatherer page (by multiverse id)
               save image file to uid.jpg (use my blackbird script)


 - figure out how to get two users into the same room with their specified decks
   - maybe embed a match id and the deck id into the url, then have route query the DB for the decklist based on deck id to pass in, + do something with the match id for socket.io?


 - implement sessions/cookies for users
   - https://stormpath.com/blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-node-dot-js-sessions/

 - implement proof of concept for full site architecture
   - login (username, password fields)
   - lobby (see other users who are logged in, show decks )
   - game
   - deckbuilder (add new decks)


 - fix the z-index (it was broken during the port from a single html file to jade/js/css)
 - implement sidebar (card blowup, chat window, turn phase, life totals, etc.)
 - buttons: shuffle library, restart game, mulligan, make token/emblem, get card, flip coin, roll die
 - figure out how to conditionally gray out certain rcmenu items
 - implement rcmenu actions
 - keyboard shortcuts for moveToXZone?
 - implement token generation

 - prevent card borders from getting grayscaled by filters
 - implement wallpapers (how do we elegantly flip a background?)
 - research reasons to use jquery selector $("#blah") vs document.querySelector("#blah")
   - https://jsperf.com/jquery-vs-document-queryselector
 - split code into separate css/js/html files


 - ? make an internal database of cards (id, image...)
 - ? decide how to animate transitions from opponent
 - ? learn how to incorporate databases into nodejs server


 - which of the following methods of connecting/querying is better?

/*
var conString = "postgres://postgres:password@localhost/mtgtestdb";

var client = new pg.Client(conString);
client.connect(function(err) {
  if(err) {
    return console.error('could not connect to postgres', err);
  }
  client.query('SELECT name FROM cards', function(err, result) {
    if(err) {
      return console.error('error running query', err);
    }
    console.log(result.rows[0].name);
    client.end();
  });
});
*/

/*
  var conString = "postgres://postgres:password@localhost/mtgtestdb";
  pg.connect(conString, function(err, client, done) {

    if (err) {
      return console.error('error fetching client from pool', err);
    }
    client.query(
      'SELECT imageurl FROM cards WHERE id = $1::int',
      ['100001'],
      function(err, result) {
        done();
        if (err) {
          return console.error('error running query', err);
        }
        console.log(result.rows[0].imageurl);
      }
    );

  });
